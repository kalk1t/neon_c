# N04 — Stacked midrise block

## Scope

Individual transparent PNG modelling reference for **R1 — Neon Downpour**. This image is concept/reference art, not a mesh, UV atlas, measured elevation, PBR texture set or finished game object. Its appearance is based on the selected R1 map concept.

## Design targets

Target width × depth × height: 30 × 24 × 32 m. These are **design targets, not measurements recovered from the image**. Use Blender dimensions to establish exact scale; do not infer a guaranteed physical clearance from the raster.

- **Construction route:** Blender preferred: stack three bevelled boxes, inset facade panels and shared window material. Meshy optional for decorative facade seed only.
- **Origin / pivot:** Center of the overall base footprint at Z=0, local X width and Y depth.
- **Collision:** Compound boxes for primary blocks; top surfaces can receive explicit roof colliders if used as crash surfaces.
- **LOD triangle targets:** LOD0 ≤ 9,000; LOD1 ≤ 3,000; LOD2 ≤ 500. Targets apply to the whole visible asset before instancing; adjust after profiling. These are budgets for future meshes, not measured counts.
- **Materials:** keep black/graphite body and glass separate from narrow emissive cyan/magenta inlays. Use shared materials/atlases where practical. Wetness belongs in roughness/normal treatment and lighting; avoid baking the map's rain and fog into the object texture.
- **Blender orientation:** values above use Z up. Check the exported glTF's up/forward convention against the game's existing importer rather than rotating it twice.

## Suggested Meshy instruction

No Meshy generation has been executed for this package. If Meshy is used for a decorative seed, submit only this isolated item image and use:

> Create one game environment prop matching the supplied isolated reference: stacked midrise block. Neutral graphite and black glass with dark chrome hardware, narrow cyan emissive strips and small magenta accents. Preserve the subject silhouette and all visible openings. No surrounding scene, no floor, no rain or fog, no text or logos. Use a clean separated hard-surface construction suitable for later Blender cleanup. Keep emission confined to lighting elements. Scale, pivots, mesh simplification and collision will be established manually in Blender.

Build accurate structural shapes and empty clearances in Blender even when using a generated seed. Remove hidden/interior debris, repair normals and reduce geometry; apply real-world size and pivot before export. Do not submit the complete map concept as one environment mesh.

## Exact image-generation prompt

Generation mode: built-in image generator, one call for this individual asset, transparent background enabled.

Reference: selected R1 Neon Downpour concept, `References/selected_map.png` in the final package (asset_records.json retains the exact source path).

```text
Use case: stylized-concept.
Asset type: individual 3D modelling reference PNG for R1 NEON DOWNPOUR, a flying-car racing game.
Input image 1 is a STYLE REFERENCE only: extract its graphite-and-glass architecture, dark chrome structures, cyan navigation strips and restrained magenta accents. Do not reproduce its scenery, typography, track, rain, cars, atmosphere or camera layout.
Primary request: ONE low stacked futuristic urban midrise building, 30 metres wide by 24 metres deep by 32 metres tall as nominal design proportions. Three offset rectilinear volumes with broad flat roof areas and integrated dark ventilation housings, black glass window bands, graphite metal cladding, narrow cyan edge illumination and very small magenta accents. Strong readable industrial city silhouette, subdued warm window flecks. One coherent building with compact footprint; no rooftop antenna, separate props, road or surrounding architecture.
Style/medium: polished stylized 3D game-asset studio render; physically readable hard-surface construction with neutral dark graphite, black glass and brushed chrome. Dark body material must stay predominantly neutral; emissive colour confined to thin inlays and small details. Moderate realistic material wear, clean silhouette and useful modelling detail.
Composition/framing: exactly ONE complete asset in a single elevated front three-quarter view, weak perspective, centered with at least 10% clear transparent margin on every side, entire silhouette visible, no crop. Match aspect ratio to subject. No exploded view, variants, collage or contact sheet.
Lighting: neutral soft studio light strong enough to read every dark surface. Restrained cyan and magenta emission, no bloom, no halo, no atmospheric light rays.
Background: genuine transparent RGBA, empty alpha outside the object and through openings. No floor, shadow, ground reflection, water plane, horizon, sky, fog, rain, city backdrop or unrelated scenery.
Text: none. No labels, title, logo, watermark, UI, dimension arrows or measurement graphics. No cars, people or weapons.
